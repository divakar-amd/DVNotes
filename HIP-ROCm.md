- Rocm vs HIP: Rocm is the big open-source stack which encomposes HIP among other things
- Compute Unit ~ executes SIMD on GPU.
- CPU is latency oriented. GPU is throughput oriented (total workload)
- MI300X:
	- CUs : 304
   	- Streaming processors = CU * 64 = 19,456
	- Mem : 192 GB
 - Host & Device maintain their own memory separately
